# Guessing_Game_in_Python
Welcome to the exciting world of the Guessing Game! Can you crack the code and find the hidden number?

# How to Play

Objective:

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to guess the mysterious number between 1 and 100.

Getting Started:

- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Run it on any IDE of your choice.

Guessing Rules:

- Enter your first guess when prompted.
- You'll receive feedback:

  "WARM!" if your guess is within 10 units of the target.

  "COLD!" if your guess is outside the 10-unit range.

Game Progress:

- For subsequent guesses, the game will tell you if you are getting "WARMER" or "COLDER."
- Keep guessing until you hit the bullseye!
- If your guess is out of bounds, the game will let you know.

Recording Tries:
- The game keeps track of your attempts and tells you how many tries it took to crack the code.

Note:
- You can make the game more engaging for yourself by changing the upper-bound from 100 to (sky's the limit) and also suitably changing the unit range.
Challenge your friends and see who can guess the number in the fewest tries!

Good luck, and happy guessing!
